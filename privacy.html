							<div class="terms-box mt-60">
								<p class="p-lg">Hi there, we’re Startcommerce Pty Ltd (ABN 58 639 546 526) of Suite 377, 30/514 Christine Ave, Robina Queensland 4226, Australia (Startcommerce) and welcome to our privacy policy which also applies to our Affiliate Companies. This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an Startcommerce user or visitor to our Sites. It applies across Startcommerce.dev, Startcommerce.com.au and SmartStudio.dev (the “Sites”).</p>
								<p class="p-lg">When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘Startcommerce’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="terms-box">
								<h5 class="h5-xl">The type of personal information we collect</h5>								
								<p class="p-lg">We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Sites.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">The most common types of information we collect include things like: usernames, member names, email addresses, IP addresses, other contact details, survey responses, blogs, photos, payment information such as payment agent details, transactional details, tax information, support queries, forum comments (if applicable), content you direct us to make available on our Sites (such as item descriptions), your actions on our Sites (including any selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data. We will also collect personal information from job applications (such as, your CV, the application form itself, cover letter and interview notes).</p>

								<h5 class="h5-xl">How we collect personal information</h5>
								<p class="p-lg">We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you navigate through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated with the Sites.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">We collect your personal information when you provide it to us when you complete membership registration and buy or provide items or services on our Sites, subscribe to a newsletter, email list, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication.</p>

								<h5 class="h5-xl">Personal information we collect about you from others</h5>
								<p class="p-lg">Although we generally collect personal information directly from you, on occasion, we also collect certain categories of personal information about you from other sources. In particular:
									financial and/or transaction details from payment providers located in the US, UK, and Australia in order to process a transaction;
									third party service providers (like Google, Facebook) who are located in the US or UK, which may provide information about you when you link, connect, or login to your account with the third party provider and they send us information such as your registration and profile from that service, this only occurs if you are using SmartStudio. The information varies and is controlled by that service provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service provider; and
									other third party sources/and or partners from Australia, US or UK, whereby we receive additional information about you (to the extent permitted by applicable law), such as demographic data or fraud detection information, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, fraud warnings from service providers like an identity verification service. We also receive information about you and your activities on and off the Startcommerce platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks. We also receive information about you as a rights holder from our third party authors. For example, information in the form of a model release when your image is used in an item made available on our Sites.</p>

								<h5 class="h5-xl">How we use personal information</h5>

									<ul class="simple-list">
										<li class="list-item">

								<h5 class="h5-xl">How long we keep your personal information</h5>

Any information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

								<h5 class="h5-xl">When we need to update this policy</h5>
								<p class="p-lg">We will need to change this policy from time to time in order to make sure it stays up to date with the latest legal requirements and any changes to our privacy management practices.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">When we do change the policy, we’ll make sure to notify you about such changes, where required. A copy of the latest version of this policy will always be available on this page.</p>

								<p class="p-lg">We’re really glad you made it to the end of the privacy policy, because knowing this stuff is the best way to understand how your personal information is used and how to best manage it!</p>
								<p class="p-lg">If you’re a user or visitor in the European Economic Area these rights also apply to you:
									<ul class="simple-list">
										<li class="list-item">
											<p class="p-md"><span class="txt-500">For the purposes of applicable EU data protection law (including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”), we are a ‘data controller’ of your personal information.</span></p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h5 class="h5-xl">How you can access your personal information</h5>
								<p class="p-lg">You are also entitled to ask us to port your personal information (i.e. to transfer in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to you), to erase it, or restrict its processing. You also have rights to object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such as profiling that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent as more fully described below.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">These rights are limited in some situations – for example, we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information. In some instances, this means that we may retain some data even if you withdraw your consent.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal information is optional.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">If you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to data protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will be the data protection authority of the country: (i) of your habitual residence; (ii) of your place of work; or (iii) in which you consider the alleged infringement has occurred.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">Both personal information and personal data have the same meaning in the context of this Privacy Policy.</p>
								<p class="p-lg">Affiliate Companies means Envato Elements Pty Ltd, Envato Twenty20 Pty Ltd, Envato Sites Pty Ltd, and Envato Placeit Pty Ltd.</p>
